### üåü About This Project

I built this website to serve as a comprehensive portfolio and personal introduction. As a licensed Structural Engineer (PE in Texas), I'm passionate about designing innovative and sustainable structures. The site provides a detailed look into my journey from SUNY Buffalo to Houston, my professional experience in industrial construction, and my hands-on approach to problem-solving, which extends to my love for renovating houses.

This is also a space for my personal side‚Äîfrom my love of music and video games to my more recent (and sometimes challenging!) hobby of golf.
